# Instructor Guide to cyber-dojo.org

To use cyber-dojo.org to set up an exercise for students:

# Step 1: Which unit testing framework?

There are two baseline starting point assumption for all usage of cyber-dojo.org:

* students will be working in a Test-Driven Development style of programming
* students will use one of the TDD frameworks supported by cyber-dojo.org

For Python, there are two supported frameworks: unittest and py.test, each with its pros and cons.

* For getting started, I recommend the py.test framework. 
* Later on we may (or may not) transition to the unittest framework.  
* Here is [more detail as to the pros/cons](py.test-vs-unittest.md)

# Step 2: Setting up your problem.  (Outside of cyber-dojo.org)

When first getting used to cyber-dojo.org, it may be best to start by setting up an initial set of test cases and solutions outside of cyber-dojo.org, and then migrating them into cyber-dojo.org.    Here is a guide to doing just that.

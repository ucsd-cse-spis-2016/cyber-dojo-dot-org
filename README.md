The website http://cyber-dojo.org/ provides an opportunity to practice programming skills in a variety of languages, including Python, the language that we are using during UCSD CSE SPIS 2016.

The site can be used for UCSD CSE SPIS 2016 in at least three ways.  Each of the items below links to a document with further details.

* [Self study in Python](/cyber-dojo-self-study-python.md) by SPIS 2016 participants, using the exercises already built into the site
* [Self study in other languages](/cyber-dojo-self-study-other-languages.md) that SPIS 2016 participants may want to learn after the conclusion of SPIS (e.g. Java, C++, etc.)

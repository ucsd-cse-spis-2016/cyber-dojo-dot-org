Given a positive integer n, compute the sum of the first n primes.

For example:
 when n is 3, return 10 (2+3+5)
 when n is 1, return 2
 when n is 6, return 34 (2+3+5+7+11+13) 

If n is not a positive integer, 
signal the error in some way appropriate to the language.
(e.g. in Python, throw the exception ValueError)

You may want to write tests and an implementation for is_prime,
and/or nth_prime first.
